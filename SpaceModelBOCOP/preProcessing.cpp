// THIS FILE IS OPTIONAL !

// The following are the input and output available variables
// in pre-processing function.

// Input :
// dim_constants : number of constants
// dim_steps : number of time steps
// constants : vector of constants
// discCoeffA : vector of Runge-Kutta coefficients
// discCoeffB : vector of Runge_Kutta coefficients
// discCoeffC : vector of Runge-Kutta coefficients

// The functions of your problem have to be written in C++ code
// Remember that the vectors numbering in C++ starts from 0
// (ex: the first component of the vector state is state[0])

// Tdouble variables correspond to values that can change during optimization:
// states and optimization parameters.
// Values that remain constant during optimization use standard types (double, int, ...).

#include "header_preProcessing"
{
    // Your pre-processing function HERE:
    return 0;
}
