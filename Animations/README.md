# Animations
These animations show epidemic progress and control strategies for four control scenarios from the main paper:
1. No control
1. 'Split' strategy
1. Risk open-loop strategy
1. Space open-loop strategy.

The animations show a single realisation of each strategy.

## Legend
The node network is shown on the left of each animation. Colours of nodes indicate the proportion of the host population that is infected, with red indicating fully infected. The size of the node represents the size of the host population. Inset bar graphs show number of hosts in each state: susceptible (S), infected (I), vaccinated (V) and removed by the disease (R). Darker portions of each bar are the high risk group.

For scenarios with control, the strategy is shown on the right. Pink shows control allocated to the high risk group, blue to the low risk group, as in the main paper. This is split by region for space open-loop strategy.
